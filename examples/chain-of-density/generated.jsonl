And this community has thrown in the towel. Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust.

Journalist Jonathan Maitland said while there had been some shock at the drama, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it. It will open in London in June, less than three years since the late comedian's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary. Scroll down for video . The author of a play which sees impressionist Alistair McGowan portray Jimmy Savile has said the public is ready for it to be shown . The revelation that Savile had abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals and schools throughout the 70s and 80s sparked an enormous Scotland Yard probe into other alleged abuse. Although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing, Maitland claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts. In an interview with The Guardian he said: 'It has changed everything; it has changed the way we look at abuse, it has changed the way we prosecute it, it has changed attitudes towards it, the way we treat the survivors of it. 'What person would not want to explore what kicked it off?' Drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of Savile's many victims, the play's central role has been given to impressionist Alistair McGowan. Most often recognised for his comedic performances, Maitland said his leading actor is also 'terrific' at embodying the 'dark, nasty' elements of the story. In his popular BBC series, The Big Impression, McGowan included Savile in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed American rapper Eminem. McGowan previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series The Big Impression. In a sketch he responds to a teenage Eminem's repeated requests to appear on Jim'll Fix It . Twitter users rejected Maitland's claim the public was 'ready' for the play, describing the subject choice as 'unbelievable' Dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by Savile, McGowan writes to the Jim'll Fix It host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent. Later he impersonates Savile himself, responding: 'It would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the TV, especially at tea time.' Sinisterly, he then tells the fictional teenage Eminem that the pair could go to Alton Towers 'in a few hours' before giggling and licking his lips. Author Jonathan Maitland said people were 'ready' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed . Before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. While Maitland said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking, he is confident the public, and Savile's victims, will be prepared for the drama. 'Yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time, but I think people are ready.' Critics have however slammed his 'unbelievable' subject choice. One Twitter user said it was 'not quite right' to portray the scandal, while another commented: 'Why not make Fritzl the musical?', referring to the Austrian predator Josef Fritzl who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse. John Caswell refuted Maitland's claim that the public were ready, responding: 'It's official, I am not people'. But a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste. 'From what Jonathan has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject ,' said Liz Dux, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon. 'After meeting with him and discussing the project at length , I'm satisfied he will not cause offence to any of the victims . In fact some have agreed to meet with him.'

If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a \u2018racer\u2019 and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been \u2018selfish\u2019 by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks \u2018positive\u2019 and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try,\u2019 he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try. \u2018They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the difference between us. I want to win always.\u201d \u2018And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. \u2018This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don\u2019t take away the fun of the racing. It\u2019s racing. I wouldn\u2019t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what Nico\u2019s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.\u2019 Hamilton\u2019s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion\u2019s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018Ultimately this is Formula One,\u2019 added Hamilton. \u2018I want the guy to be up my a*** if he\u2019s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can\u2019t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn\u2019t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.\u2019 The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year\u2019s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans\u2019 questions. One asked if he was \u2018crying\u2019 \u2013 by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: \u2018You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind and I\u2019ll try to show respect when it\u2019s due going forward.\u2019 Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? \u2018It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,\u2019 said the German. \u2018But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn\u2019t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. \u2018So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that\u2019s what I was building up to. \u2018The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths.

But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting.

A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June.

The international designer and her husband carefully renovated the property to be 'very sympathetic and in keeping with the period style, while still keeping it contemporary', said Mr Collier. Mr Collier said that the owners loved the combination of the house's proximity to restaurants and cafes, along with the unusually large terrace which makes the property an actual house. 'Most terraces in the area are around six metres, but the property's terrace is about twice that,' he said.

Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as a teenager with West Ham United and if \u2013 as now seems likely \u2013 he carries through to Euro 2016, he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years. Matthews won his 54 England caps over a 23-year period between 1934 and 1957, interrupted of course by the Second World War. Michael Carrick's appearance for England against Italy on Tuesday night keeps him in the longest-serving list . Carrick has played for England for 13 years, 310 days - while Sir Stanley Matthews reached 22 years, 228 days . Sir Stanley runs with the ball in action for England against Brazil at Wembley in an international friendly . Stanley Matthews (1934-57) 22 yrs, 228 days . Peter Shilton (1970-90) 19 yrs, 224 days .

Bobby Moore (1962-73) 11 yrs, 178 days . Gary Lineker (1984-1992) 8 yrs, 22 days . Carrick was hailed by Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney as 'the best player on the pitch by a mile' after the 33-year-old was introduced as a half-time substitute in Turin and helped Roy Hodgson's men fight back to earn a 1-1 draw. His longevity already surpasses that of great names like Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Gary Lineker and if he continues to play in the next European Championship he will overtake Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard too. The only player to have had a longer career since Matthews is goalkeeper Peter Shilton who played for England between 1971 and 1990. It also begs the question why Carrick, who has won four Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United, has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments. He played once at the 2006 World Cup in a 1-0 victory against Ecuador, was in the squad but never played by Fabio Capello in the disastrous 2010 campaign in South Africa, and wasn't even selected by Roy Hodgson last year in Brazil, even though England's perennial problem has been keeping the ball. With Rooney now captain and clearly a huge fan of the midfielder, it seems unlikely Carrick will be overlooked again and is now finally getting the recognition he deserves.

Between Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Juventus, the big-eared trophy has been lifted 21 times. Any of those clubs would be deserving finalists in the Olympiastadion in Berlin on June 6. But for tension, intrigue, and the potential for high drama, the match-up that most appeals has to be Real Madrid versus Barcelona. Javier Hernandez's late winner against Atletico Madrid sent Real Madrid into the Champions League semis . Neymar scored both goals in the second leg as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 5-1 on aggregate . Transporting El Clasico to east Germany would bring a defining chapter to a myriad narratives, raising Europe\u2019s grandest derby to a level not seen amid years of ebb and flow between the two Spanish behemoths. We have seen plenty of tangles in recent years, notably the Champions League semi-final of 2011, and some may insist the unseemly battles when the pair faced off 12 times in 19 months a couple of years ago became too much. But never have they duelled in the continent's largest match. That would crystalise their competition. It would be a fascinating game. Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League trophy and second in a row with Real . Barcelona's formidable front three of Luis Suarez (left), Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) They have only met twice this season, both times in La Liga. Real Madrid won 3-1 at the Bernabeu before Christmas before Barcelona's 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month, so the appetite is not sated this campaign. A deciding third bout at Europe\u2019s main event would draw global crowds not witnessed before. Just think: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the pre-eminent practitioners of this era, head-to-head for the biggest club prize of all. The Preener v the Peruser, Portugal\u2019s athletic might against Argentina\u2019s diminutive delight, the current Ballon d\u2019Or holder against the man who won four consecutively. Barcelona won 3-1 on aggregate when the sides met in the semi-finals of the 2011 Champions League . Gareth Bale scored the winner when Real Madrid beat Barcelona in the 2014 Spanish Cup final . Bale celebrates at the Mestalla after scoring a wonder goal that won the Spanish Cup for Barcelona . Pep Guardiola could come up against his former team Barcelona after guiding Bayern into the last four . Then there's the undercard fights for supremacy: Gareth Bale, the world\u2019s most expensive signing on paper, vying with Neymar, the game\u2019s costliest player when all told; Karim Benzema, that deadly Frenchman, versus Luis Suarez, the indefatigable Uruguayan (both tied on six Champions League goals this season, by the way). Both teams have a trident attack to strike fear into their opponents. Whose will triumph on the biggest stage? It is an intriguing question to pose. Then we have Carlo Ancelotti trying to save his job by going for his fourth European Cup as a manager, against Luis Enrique, who has weathered a storm in his debut season to break the record for number of club wins (42) in a head coach's first 50 games. As a player he won La Liga with both Real and Barca but never the Champions League. Messi and Ronaldo have had many duels, and could have another one this season in the Champions League . Pepe heads home during Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Barcelona in the Clasico at the Bernabeu in October . Suarez scored what proved to be the winner when Barcelona won the La Liga meeting in March . Pep Guardiola facing his old club, the place he delivered dream football and two European Cups, would be tantalising \u2013 be we can have that in the semi-final. He needs to visit the Nou Camp as an opposition manager. That would leave Real vs Juventus in the other last-four match. Two teams with plenty of shared history, not least the 1998 Champions League final when the Italian side\u2019s Zinedine Zidane, now a Real coach, was denied by Predrag Mijatovic\u2019s goal.

Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu .

The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50.

'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.'

The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament\u00a0after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods \u00a0waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground . The former world number one let go of his club and shook his hand after hurting his wrist during after playing a shot in pine needles . His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions. Spieth (above with girlfriend Annie Verret on her 21st birthday)\u00a0is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds . On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother. She says Ellie helps the young superstar stay so grounded. 'Jordan wouldn't be where he's at today if he didn't grow up with Ellie,' said Mrs. Spieth in an interview with ESPN. 'Jordan realizes this isn't real life at the Masters. Trying to sit around and have dinner when his sister doesn't want to eat when everybody else is eating and has a fit, that's real life.'

It\u2019s April and my first proper swim of the year. The North Sea stretches before me. I dip a toe in. It\u2019s absolutely freezing . . . of course. I wobble over the sharp shingle, into the waves, until I\u2019m waist-deep. Gasping for breath, I take the plunge. And, within seconds, making frantic strokes, I\u2019m swept up and I\u2019m swimming. And it is glorious. Scroll down for video . Sarah Foot says her affair with open water began on Hampstead Heath after a local swimming pool closed down, and has taken her to swimming in the North Sea off the coast of Suffolk (pictured) I\u2019m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl -\u00a0I\u2019m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke . You don\u2019t have to be watching Poldark for a dip in the sea to set your heart racing. I love to swim. Miserable winters, exams, love affairs . . . I\u2019ve swum through them all, wherever I can find the water. Most of the time this means municipal pools from which I emerge reeking of chlorine and praying I\u2019ve avoided verrucas. So best of all has to be swimming outdoors, and here on the East coast in Suffolk it is now warm enough \u2014 just about \u2014 for the sea. And despite the greyness, the appalling cold, and the downright bleakness of the North Sea here, I\u2019m in heaven. The poet Byron \u2014 who was every bit as proud of his phenomenal swimming prowess as his verses \u2014 called the experience a \u2018buoyancy of spirits I never feel on any other occasion\u2019. I don\u2019t have to swim the four-mile-long Hellespont between Asia and Europe as he did to know what he meant. I, too, am buoyed up in every way. Yet I\u2019m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek, racing crawl. Nor am I that hardy chap I read about recently, known as the \u2018human polar bear\u2019, who swims round icebergs in the Arctic. A 30-minute dip leaves me exhausted. I can\u2019t even dive. You need look no further than Aidan Turner in Poldark to see how a dip in the ocean can set pulses racing . I\u2019m that woman with the white-hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke. But in the water I don\u2019t care. And, for me, that\u2019s the magic of swimming. I am completely free. For a few precious moments, all my troubles wash away. Nothing bothers me and my whole world flows \u2018swimmingly\u2019. Of course, it would be easier to get in if it weren\u2019t so damned cold \u2014 nudging a steely 8C (47F). Yet however enticing it is to bask in languid, tropical waters along with colourful fish, and laze about in Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, give me the Atlantic any day. Because, for me, the most perfect swim of all is in Scotland, off the Hebrides. What I love is the emptiness, the menthol cool of the water. On the Isle of Islay I have found deserted bays and swum completely alone or just with those I love, the sea crystal-clear and only the sound of the curlews and the water lapping over the rock pools. It\u2019s not warm, of course, but immersed in that wild sea is the closest to beauty I have ever been. Why does it affect me so? Freud, not surprisingly, had a view on a love of swimming. He believed it disguised a desire to return to the amniotic waters of the womb. But that\u2019s the sort of Freudian thing he would say. I prefer the thoughts of novelist Jane Austen, so much more restrained, who simply declared swimming \u2018delightful\u2019. She found the combination of sea air and sea water \u2018nearly infallible\u2019 and \u2018a match for every disorder\u2019. To the Romans, swimming was a most manly, heroic occupation, so much so that they defined an ignorant man as one who \u2018neither knows how to read or swim\u2019. Caligula, the cruel and brutally wanton Roman emperor, deemed himself a god but his contemporaries whispered he was a wimp \u2014 behind his back, presumably \u2014 because he couldn\u2019t manage a front crawl or even a doggy-paddle. I came across a similar attitude when I lived in London and finally plucked up the courage to swim in the famous, natural, spring-fed ponds on Hampstead Heath. The exclusive ladies pond is in a picture-perfect setting, surrounded by trees and wild flowers. But I was scared to go in. The problem was I couldn\u2019t see the bottom. The water was so black and deep, my thoughts would turn black and ominous too, imagining drowning and wondering how many rats were lurking in the murky shadows. But one day, the local indoor pool I used was unexpectedly closed. So I braved the pond. And it was a revelation. I felt I was swimming through silk. I never knew water could be so soft and I forgot about the rats and the unknown depths. And with all the passion of a convert I became so keen on the fresh water and splashing about with ducks I was determined to swim there all year round. Poet Lord Byron (left) was a prodigious swimmer, once crossing the four-mile Hellespont from Asia to Europe, while Jane Austen praised the sea air and water as 'a match for every disorder' I bought neoprene gloves and shoes and, as autumn came and the temperature dropped, I invested in a wet-suit. Because although there is something to be said for the way you emerge from cold water stinging and tingling as if heated by a feverish drug, I\u2019m not hardy enough for swimming through liquid ice. But, unfortunately, I was not allowed to wear my new wetsuit \u2014 \u2018not in the spirit of the ponds\u2019, I was told by the strict Hampstead matriarchs who police it. And my passion faltered and I had to wait again for warmer weather. The coldness of our climate meant that, for centuries in Britain, swimming in the wild for pleasure was considered close to madness. The sea and rivers were regarded as sources of disease rather than pleasure. And the Church saw swimming as a rather sinful pursuit, possibly because Romans treated it as the opportunity for more erotic activities than a few hale and hearty lengths. But then, at the end of the 18th century, George III gave swimming the royal stamp of approval by taking dips in the sea off Weymouth, accompanied apparently by a band who struck up God Save The King every time he popped his head out of the water. In 1824, Britain\u2019s first swimming society was formed by a group of Old Etonians. The David Camerons and Boris Johnsons of their day initiated non-swimmers by taking them out onto the River Thames and chucking them in. The Victorians had more gentle ways of learning to swim. A Boys Own Paper of 1879 suggested learning from frogs \u2014 by catching one, putting it in a bowl of water and then lying your body across a table and imitating the way it moved. George III brought swimming to fashion in England after years of scepticism from prudish members of the church . Whatever methods people learned to swim they were effective and, as more people took to the waters, something had to be done, in the name of modesty, about the habit of swimming naked. A cover-up campaign began, much to the annoyance of Francis Kilvert, a West Country curate who, in 1872, complained about the \u2018detestable custom of bathing in drawers\u2019. He loved \u2018the delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea\u2019. Forced to put on underwear (red and white striped) to conceal himself, he complained that: \u2018If ladies don\u2019t like to see men naked, why don\u2019t they keep away from the sight?\u2019 Indeed given the hysteria generated by Poldark actor Aidan Turner\u2019s quick Cornish dip, watching men swimming seems to be a pleasure that has never dimmed. Personally, I hate being seen swimming, though others clearly don\u2019t. On the nearest beach to me, the determinedly old-fashioned Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast, I watch doughty local residents wander through the town in great towelling robes for a morning dip, proudly showing off bodies leathered and tanned by years of immersion in the sea. They are following in the footsteps of the composer Benjamin Britten, the town\u2019s most famous resident, who extolled the virtues of cold water \u2018just to wake you up\u2019. On a good day, he\u2019d manage as many as five \u2018bathes\u2019, as he called them, fitting them in between rehearsals and lunch, as well as late at night in the moonlight. His love affair with water lasted through his whole life. He composed the piano piece Early Morning Bathe, which captures all the initial pain and ultimate pleasure of a swim off the English coast \u2014 that \u2018it\u2019s lovely when you\u2019re in\u2019 feeling. But the problem, for me, is the indignity of actually getting in and out of the sea. It\u2019s bad enough trying to keep your feet as you stagger in. But, unless it is unusually calm, there\u2019s not a hope of emerging from the surf with the composure of bikini-clad Ursula Andress in the Bond film Dr No. As I get out, the waves can be so pebble-filled-heavy I\u2019m often hurled flat on my face and have to scrabble over the stones on my stomach.\u00a0But the humiliation of looking like a seal heaving itself onto dry land is worth it for the joy of that swim. So I will continue to confront the North Sea, take delight when the temperature climbs a few degrees as we head into summer in the weeks ahead and then grit my teeth again as it plummets back into winter. Because I know from experience that, whatever the season, once I\u2019m swimming, I\u2019m reminded, however briefly, how wonderful it is to be alive.)`"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "GeneratedSummary", "arguments": "{\n  \"summary\": \"Endurance-swimming in the frosty North Sea inspired a profound sense of liberation in a non-athlete.

The Ukip leader was booed by voters at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall as he faced claims he blamed all of Britain's problems on migrants. Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using\u00a0random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News\u00a0Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru\u00a0supporters\u00a0were\u00a0brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage:\u00a0'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter\u00a0Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate,\u00a0Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.
