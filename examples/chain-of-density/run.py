        - The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, ~80 words) yet highly non-specific,
          containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose
          language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~80 words.
        - Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for
          additional entities.
        - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses."
        - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood
          without the article.
        - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
        - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.
